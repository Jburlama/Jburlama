# ‚≠ê Hello there!!

üëã My name is **Jhonas**, and I am a **software developer** üë®‚Äçüíª currently studying at **42Porto**. 

üíª On my GitHub, you will find a variety of my personal projects, as well as projects from 42 school and other online certificates üèÖ. I am most comfortable working with **C, C++, Python, and SQL** üêçüíæ.

üîß I have a strong interest in **embedded systems** and **web development** üõ†Ô∏è. While I am capable of full-stack development, I prefer to focus most of my time on back-end ‚öôÔ∏è.
